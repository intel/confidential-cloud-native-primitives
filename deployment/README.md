# CCNP Deployment Guide


## Create TD

CCNP is designed for collecting confidential computing primitives for cloud native environments. It's designed to run as daemon set on confidential virtual machines nodes, such as Intel Trust Domain (TD), in a Kubernetes cluster.
You can use [cvm image rewriter](../tools/cvm-image-rewriter/README.md) to prepare a TD enlightened guest image and start a TD using [qemu-test.sh](../tools/cvm-image-rewriter/qemu-test.sh)

## Prepare a K8S cluster with TD as worker nodes

You can either create a K8S cluster in the TD or let the TD join an existing K8S cluster. Please choose one of the following step to make sure the K8S cluster is prepared with the TD running in it. CCNP will be deployed on the TD later.

### Option 1: Create a K8S cluster on the TD
After TDs are started, users need to setup a K8S cluster in the TDs. Please refer to the [k8s official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) for detailed steps. 

_NOTE: If the cluster has only one node (master node), the taint on the node needs to be removed._

### Option 2: Add the TD to an existing K8S cluster
TBD

## Deploy CCNP

- [image-manager.sh](../deployment/script/image-manager.sh): The tool will build 5 images and push them to remote registry if required.
- [deploy-ccnp.sh](../deployment/script/deploy-ccnp.sh): The tool will deploy CCNP services as DaemonSet on TDs in the K8S cluster.
- [deploy-and-exec-ccnp-example.sh](../deployment/script/deploy-and-exec-ccnp-example.sh): The tool will deploy an example pod and show getting event logs, measurement and perform verification using CCNP in the pod.

### Prerequisite
- Install Helm on the TD nodes. Please refer to the [HELM quick start](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/).
- Install docker on the TD nodes. Please refer to [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Install python3-pip on the TD nodes. Please refer to [pip document](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
- Set access permission to TD device node on the TD nodes.
```
$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/udev/rules.d
$ sudo touch /etc/udev/rules.d/90-tdx.rules

# Check TD device node on TD
$ ls /dev/tdx*

# If above output is "/dev/tdx-guest"
$ sudo bash -c 'echo "SUBSYSTEM==\"misc\",KERNEL==\"tdx-guest\",MODE=\"0666\"">/etc/udev/rules.d/90-tdx.rules'
# If above output is "/dev/tdx_guest"
$ sudo bash -c 'echo "SUBSYSTEM==\"misc\",KERNEL==\"tdx_guest\",MODE=\"0666\"">/etc/udev/rules.d/90-tdx.rules'

$ sudo udevadm trigger
$ sudo mkdir -p  /run/ccnp/uds
$ sudo chmod o+w /run/ccnp/uds
```

### Build CCNP images

Run below scripts to generate CCNP images. It will generate 5 images and push them to user specific registry.

```
$ cd scripts
$ sudo ./image-manager.sh -r <remote registry> -g <docker image tag>

e.g.

# Build images with tag 0.3 and push them to remote registry test-registry.intel.com
$ sudo ./image-manager.sh -r test-registry.intel.com/test -g 0.3

# Build images only with tag 0.3
$ sudo ./image-manager.sh -a build -g 0.3
```

_NOTE: please set `HTTP_PROXY``, `HTTPS_PROXY``, `NO_PROXY`` in your session if they are needed in your environments._

After the script is successful, it's supposed to see below docker images.

```
$ sudo docker images
ccnp-node-measurement-example   <your image tag>
ccnp-eventlog-server            <your image tag>
ccnp-measurement-server         <your image tag>
ccnp-quote-server               <your image tag>
ccnp-device-plugin              <your image tag>
```

### Deploy CCNP services
CCNP deployment tool will deploy TDX device plugin and daemon sets for CCNP event log, measurement and quote.

```
# Deploy CCNP with user specified remote registry and image tag
$ sudo ./deploy-ccnp.sh -r <remote registry> -g <tag>
e.g.
$ sudo ./deploy-ccnp.sh -r test-registry.intel.com/test -g 0.3

# Delete existing CCNP and Deploy CCNP with user specified remote registry and image tag
$ sudo ./deploy-ccnp.sh -r <remote registry> -g <tag> -d

```

After it's successful, you should see ccnp-device-plugin helm release and 3 daemon set in namespace `ccnp`.

```
$ sudo helm list

```

## Install CCNP SDK

There are two options to install CCNP SDK.  
Option 1: Users can run the following command on each work node to install CCNP client library for Python with PyPI.
```
pip install ccnp
```
Option 2: Users can also run the following commands to install CCNP SDK from source code.
```
cd confidential-cloud-native-primitives/sdk/python3/
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```
At this step, CCNP has been installed successfully. For more detailed information, including SDK usage, please refer to [here](https://intel.github.io/confidential-cloud-native-primitives/).


## CCNP example
The script [deploy-and-exec-ccnp-example.sh](../deployment/script/deploy-and-exec-ccnp-example.sh) is an example of using CCNP to collect event log, measurement and perform verification in a pod.
```
$ cd script
$ sudo ./deploy-and-exec-ccnp-example.sh

# You can also specify which integrity measurement register (RTMR in the case of Intel TD)
# e.g. Show RTMR[1] and RTMR[2] using below command
$ sudo ./deploy-and-exec-ccnp-example.sh 1 2
```
